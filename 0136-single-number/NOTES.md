METHOD: USING BITWISE XOR OPERATOR (USING CONSTANT SPACE )
To use this approach you first need to understand about Bitwise XOR operator.
Most of us who have a background in physics ( highschool level ) , are aware of the LOGIC GATES.
One of such gates is the XOR Gate :
According to this gate , the output is true , only if both the inputs are of opposite kind .
That is ,
A B Y
0 0 0
0 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 0

We apply the extended version of this gate in our bitwise XOR operator.
If we do "a^b" , it means that we are applying the XOR gate on the 2 numbers in a bitwise fashion ( on each of the corresponding bits of the numbers).
Similarly , if we observe ,

A^A=0
A^B^A=B
(A^A^B) = (B^A^A) = (A^B^A) = B This shows that position doesn't matter.
Similarly , if we see , a^a^a......... (even times)=0 and a^a^a........(odd times)=a
